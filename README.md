WHY PYTHON: Python is an open source (free), object-oriented, high-level programming language that is widely used in web- and app-development, software applications, data sciences and much more. It is fast becoming a standard tool among science researchers for its ease-of-use, wealth of specialized libraries and add-ons, and convenience of notebook environments for collaboration and sharing results. Python also benefits from a large community of dedicated users who provide no shortage of tutorial videos and online support for those less advanced users (see tutorial links below).

HOW: There are many different ways to run python code (scripts) on your machine. Once downloaded you can write python code in a text editor like notepad++, Atom, vim, etc, and execute code through the terminal (mac/linux) or the command prompt (pc); or you can write code in an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) like, VScode, Spyder, PyCharm, etc, which combines the functionality of a text editor and executor, as well as including developer tools like auto-completion and debuggers, into one user interface; or you can use notebooks like jupyter or google collab, which I will be using for these tutorials, which combines most of the features of IDE's but allow code to be run interactively in small chunks which greatly improves readability (and therefore shareability) and ease of debugging. Personally I use notebooks exclusively for developing and testing new code and IDE' as a version control for finished, working, code.

INSTALLING PYTHON AND JUPYTER NOTEBOOK: The easiest and most seamless way to install python, the associated packages, and jupyter notebook is to first install a package manager called Anaconda. Click the link below and follow the instructions for your computers distribution (mac, linux, pc).

https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Once complete head to the below link and follow the instruction to install either jupyter lab or jupyter notebook. Jupyter lab and jupyter notebook are very similar, with the notebook version being more barebones.

https://jupyter.org/install

Note: with Anaconda installed any future packages that you need may be installed in the same way as jupyter, i.e."conda install name_of_package".
To open jupyter notebook once installed you can navigate through the Anaconda application or you can type "jupyter notebook" into terminal or command prompt which will open a notebook environment through your browser.

GOOGLE COLLAB: If you want to avoid the complications that come with installation, packages, and irksome dependencies, Google has a free and easy-to-use notebook environment called Google Colaboratory which combines the usefulness of notebooks with the online/sharing/auto-saving goodness of Google Drive.
Simply go to your Google Drive (if you have a google account) and create a new document; under "more" you should find "Colaboratory" which will open a new python notebook. For more info see the links below, the first is a tutorial and the second opens a notebook directly.

LIBRARIES: There are many libraries that will be very useful to us for science/math applications. A short list includes, but is not limited to, numpy (math and arrays), matplotlib (plotting tools), pandas (save/read/munge data), scipy (numerical routines and curve fitting), and much more. The links below will provide tutorials for each of these libraries. Moreover, many libraries will be presented in the tutorial.

GENERAL CODING TIPS:
1. Use the documentation
2. Read and try to understand any error messages your code produces
3. If you did 2. and you are still confused refer to the documentation or Stack Overflow
4. Remember coding is best learned by DOING. Tutorials are great but only practice makes perfect
